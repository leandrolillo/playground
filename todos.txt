Tech debts
- split audioRunner and openALRunner. Move openGLRunner and openALRunner to their own libraries (only leave audio and video runner interfaces in playground)?

- split tests closer to classes rather than runners

- make all libraries public to troubleshoot includes

- Add toString to playground that will return the current playground information:
	- name?
	- all runners toString
		- each runner would add its relevant information
			- e.g.: collision tester pairs
  
  - Create cache class and use it to store resources in resourcemanager.
    
  - review resource adapters chaining load/addResource calls. Unify resourceManager/resourceLoadRequest/resourceLoadResponse in a single class (make it simpler)?
  	- issue is getResourceManager()->load(...) is not propagating labels nor options unless calling with a resourceLoadRequest clone.

- troubleshoot grid renderer - while it does not crash, it renders nothing

- unit tests - keep adding. Each issue fixed should have an unit test

- replace printf by streams and toString() by << operator

- Refactor Parsers: support xml, yaml and json - should work the same just by switching the implementation class. Use streams.
  - Support skipping unknown properties

- review RAII and 5 of 5 principle (move semantics / perfect forwarding) in resources/playground classes.
	specially in file parser / text parser and resources.
	- resources that contain graphics handles (such as vertex shaders) should be move only
	- ideally all resources should be stateless, "definitions", and thus be move only. Resource manager returns pointers to them. 
	     However this causes issues with openAL sources <-- openAL sources should not be resources but audioRunner objects instead.
	- resource manager load should return const resources (to avoid modifications).

- review design of particle manager/collision detector / geometry vs particles / etc. Too much vector passing and copying. Review polymorfism / std::vector<unique_ptr> usage.

- Review collision detection / response: there is no way to configure restitution factor - should be based on the two objects colliding and/or configurable.

- improve box rendering (normals)

----------------

New stuff:
- blockout: following udemy learn advanced modern c++ 
    - menus, sound effects, victory message and multiple levels
    - paddle: with hierarchical boundary / logic to deflect the ball based on distance to center

- Road fighter:
	- Add textured object code support, so that I can load and display a 3d object instead of having to load the vertex array, texture and material separatedly. 
	- Add labels to resources, so that we can unload a level resources and load next levels.


- add option to stop background music

- TerrainDemo: 
	- Add class to compose several terrain patches and make calculations to determine which patch. 
	- mod infinite terrain? render those inside camera frustrum
	- Add some class to generate bounding geometry from this.
	- Some other tree model
	- Add grass / ferns with transparency
	- use own particle class or review design (lambdas maybe?) - currently it is using class from a different demo

	- evolve this demo to be a planet and then a solar system.

Games: 
- Battle city
- road fighter 
- tanques vs naves
- defend the tower
- scenery (with train or racing cars - lightning mcqueen and cruz, wind/rain, vegetation and animals, water, day/night transition, sun and moon, etc.)
